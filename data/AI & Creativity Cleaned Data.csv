5,"For the primary training program, there should a basic leadership skill training before any diving training is brought in. The first stage of this program will be called part 1. The initial part of this program will be about building a strong team while supporting differents. This program will include a lecture on recognizing each person strengths and weaknesses. It will highlight the importance of using those strengths to the whole groups benefits. It will also discuss the importance of being comfortable with the uncomfortable. The lecture will discuss teaching the team to be okay with feeling frustrated with their own personal weakness but learning to be okay with those feelings. The managers will be leading the team by overseeing the team but not overstepping. Warnings about being a supportive leader over a overtaking leader. 
I assume a dive shop also offers diving advice and even lead groups,. I would imagine that the managers would need to be well versed in diving and diving language. The second part of the training program would include diving knowledge which I got form chat gpt. This list generated included dive safety, importance of conservation, leadership in diving and working with groups, and dive planning. Gas management is also a good a skill for a dive shop worker to understand as they would being selling oxygen tanks. Also managers would need to be educated on local diving sites and recommendations for levels of diving.  Chat gpt also suggested leadership skills in leading dives with safety, good communication, and team unity. It generates that managers would also need to recognize good skills in the team and boost team morale. Also, there is a needed sense of customer satisfaction that managers must also take into consideration.

7,"I used ChatGPT to get a starting point for how I would train someone for a manager position at a dive shop they are currently employed at.  All of the big ideas written below came from ChatGPT, but the further detail as to how I would implement them I thought of myself.
1. Assessment and Feedback: After I have selected my candidates for the managerial position, I would assess all of the candidates to see what traits they have which may/may not make them most suitable for this job.  This would be a questionnaire of sorts, and from the results I would decide how I need to work with each employee to train them to be the best manager for this company.
2. Communication: I would provide training to the employees selected for the manager position both verbally and written.  This means that I would train them on the job, perhaps have them shadow current managers to see how they do their job and compare it to how the upcoming manager may change things or keep things the same.  But, I would also ensure that the managers would have ""assignments"" to do at home to prepare them for this position.  These assignments could be writing up a plan to create a safe work place, planning a group outing, and keeping a journal every day they shadow a current manager.  These at home tasks would keep the employee on the right track to be the best manager possible for this company.
3. Project Management: In the last section I talked about letting the manager in training try planning an event or project for the workplace, in this section it would then be them actually implementing this plan and seeing what goes right, what goes wrong, and what may need to be changed in the future.
4. Cross-Functional Exposure: I would ensure that the employee in training were subjected to all areas of this company so they know how all of the gears work together to create a smooth running machine.
5. Continuous Learning: The manager in training would be required to keep an eye out for ways he/she/they can learn something new every day for the betterment of the company.",Yes,,11,13,14,6,12,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Strongly Agree,No,Completely Inexperienced
8,"The upcoming managers need to have an understanding of all the diving equipment being sold and used at the dive shop. To get them familiar with the equipment, visual aids like diagrams, videos, and presentations can be used to explain the different types of diving equipment, their components, and how they are used. In addition, hands-on demonstrations in which the upcoming managers can touch and see the equipment should be performed. In addition, we should set up equipment handling drills where participants practice handling and using the gear in a controlled environment to become more familiar with how each piece of equipment works and how to troubleshoot any issues. Customer service skills and team management skills are also very important for managers to have. To be able to provide the best customer service, the upcoming managers should be familiar with the equipment (which all the previous equipment training should help with) and they should be familiar with how tools in the shop work (like the register). I think team management relies heavily on each team member respecting the manager. To foster this trust and respect, having some sort of team-building exercise could help everyone be comfortable around each other. I know that arguments and disagreements happen, so the upcoming managers should learn how to deal with issues promptly and impartially, seeking solutions that benefit the team as a whole. The manager should also be familiar with the business operations of the dive shop, including inventory management, scheduling, sales, and marketing. The key points of the business operations can be presented to the upcoming managers in a presentation. If people feel they struggle to learn this way, a more interactive sort of presentation may be more helpful to keep the participants engaged. I also think hands-on learning is important. So, while training the upcoming managers, it may be beneficial to have someone who is currently a manager have the upcoming managers shadow them for a week to give them practice in dealing with common situations. In addition, this gives the upcoming managers someone to ask questions and receive advice from while they are still getting used to things.

After he’s had some time to watch the next couple months will be integrating him to the manager position. This will start slowly as he will pick up certain roles, but not all.

If it is not unanimous then it doesn’t happen and he works on whatever the manager thinks he needs to work on. Once that manager believes he has fulfilled that role it will go to a revote.

19,"My program would consist of five different parts; conflict resolution, motivation, accountability, delegation, and new employee training. The first part ""conflict resolution"" would be designed to have the managers undergoing different simulations within the workplace where employees are disgruntled with them or another employee. The simulation would consist of hypothetical scenarios and managers would learn skills on how to deal with these situations. This training section would take two hours. The second part ""motivation"" would be centered around psychological techniques to improve productivity and also prevent burnout in employees. The managers would undergo a day's training with a behavioral psychologist to understand how best to motivate their employees. The third part of the training ""accountability"" would consist of teaching the managers the systems of accountability that the company has put in place such as time sheets, task lists, work schedules, etc. This would occur over an hour. The fourth part of the training program would consist of ""delegation"" and would be paired with accountability. During this section of the training the managers would be taught proper delegation techniques and strategies they can implement to avoid micromanagement. This would be a one hour training. The fifth part of the training would be ""new employee training"" in which for three hours the managers would learn how to properly train new employees as well as how to fill out all paper work associated with the hire.

20,"Leadership training program:
First I will have all the upcoming mangers meet in one place.
They will play the name game to build trust and a good environment in the workplace 
Then I will have them attend a leadership seminar with a world star diver who can teach them the ins and outs of leadership. 
Then I will have them do team building bonding activities such as trust falls and having them problem solve as a group. 
They watch watch diving videos and then go to a lake afterwards and dive. 
Each of them will shadow the managers for a day to see what their work is like and what they do. This way they get the opportunity to ask questions. 
Then I will make them practice leadership through fake situations. I will act out the situation when they'd need to use leadership and see how they would solve the issue. For example, I would pretend that I need help because I am getting hurt by yelling ""someone please help!"" A true leader would take action and do something to get help whether its calling the police or getting other people around to help.
Good leaders know how to be good followers. I will give them a 20 step directions on how to do a particular dive and see if they are able to follow.
This training would go on for about 3 weeks to ensure that everyone is properly trained and ready to become leaders.
To celebrate training being done we would go to the beach and celebrate. Down at the beach people could dive into the water, go cliff diving, and do so much more.

21,I would create classes to best prepare them through a leadership program. These classes would go over strength training and look at things like individuals Clifton Strengths. I would bring in guest speakers to talk about their experiences and provide insight to the employees. It's always motivating to hear about other people's experiences in how they reached their goals and success they've had. There would be a lot of team building activities to go over the importance of teamwork and give people the opportunity to be leaders. I think it would be important to have some group projects and also some individual aspects to grow working in community and individually. Having some self-reflection pieces would also be helpful to grow and challenge yourself within the program. Brain-storming ideas for the dive shop as a group would also be a part of the program. ,,,11,8,11,12,11,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Yes,Relatively Experienced
22,"If I were to develop a leadership training program for managers, I would set up a retreat full of different activities and events that promotes leadership skills. In this retreat, I would have different public speakers who are the head of large corporations to come and talk about why they think leadership is important for their companies. I believe that learning from other leaders in how they personally lead allows for future leaders to gain an understanding of what they believe is important to be a leader. Learning from other leaders, especially ones who are especially famous and lead a lot of people, is a great way to obtain great leadership skills. Although learning from other leaders is great, it is also important to put those implications learned from other leaders into practice at this retreat. The future managers will have to use their leadership skills in solving a problem together. I would ask an open ended question about a problem and they would have to work together to come up with a solution. Working together with their other future managers will help them learn leadership skills in a big group setting. Putting leaders in a group together to solve a problem will allow outside people to understand who is well trained in utilizing their leadership skills in a big group setting. Practicing leadership in a group setting can lead to putting the leadership skills into play with a large company or corporation.

23,"I think that for the training of potential managers at this dive shop I would propose a training program that emphasis problem solving and the importance of communication. The program would consist of several parts. The first part would be where all of the individuals involved discussed the traits they have that make them qualified to be leaders for this program. The second part would be brainstorming how to add to these qualities. After that, the participants would spend time learning about the specific traits we desire in our managers. This process could look like watching informational videos depicting what characteristics are valuable and under what contexts they would best be implemented. Following this, there could be another informational process where they learn about the rules and responsibilities that our managers are expected to uphold. Additionally, in this course they could learn about certain methods of dealing with these responsibilities that will help them do their job in an effective manner. Once knowing these specifics, they would be expected to be able to display this knowledge. To do this, they would be divided into groups where some act out a fake scenario that requires management, and the others would come in and respond in the manner that they best see fit, using their new skills and knowledge. After this exercise, the participants could take time to reflect on their performance and that of their peers. After leaving feedback, there could be a closing meeting where the most important notes are repeated. Once this is done, we could select the most impressive candidates (the ones who reacted in the most realistic and beneficial ways) to be our future managers.

24,"The first thing I would do in this training program is figure out the values of our company and the characteristics we look for in a good manager. I would base my program off of those values, ensuring that whoever the manager is truly embodies the values of the company. I would obviously teach them how to run the shops effectively and efficiently, but I think some of the most important qualities to look for when hiring is whether or not that person exemplifies the values of the company. I would inform these people exactly the type of people we’re looking for and what we expect from our managers. It’s important for them to know that going forward. The training from then on would be pretty self explanatory, presentations on goals and expectations and hands on examples of how the shops would be ran in a perfect world. I would also probably add some negative situations and how to handle them so that the candidates are fully prepared for anything that might be thrown their way and can handle it in a way that the company expects them too.

25,"I would want to incorporate as much application for this training program as possible. That means getting them engaged in using the diving equipment, very detailed hands on learning tutorials on how to use the equipment; especially using it in a safe manner as well. Another portion of my training program would be revolves around scenario based application. Prior to this training; there will be scenarios of situations; such as malfunctioning of equipment and how to deal with any type of emergency. These scenarios would be elaborated through a lecture and testing type of program; which elicits the trainees understanding of how to be safe and be able to adapt on the go without second guessing. Regarding the employee efficiency with performance and efficiency; I believe that each diver trainee should be able to set-up their equipment without instruction; as well as be able to understand the mechanics of how each piece of equipment works. I feel that this is important; especially in being a well rounded dive crew; and being efficient and knowledgeable as a community. When it comes to the business portion of this company; I would like each employee to understand what the companies mission is; as well as how to promote and uplift any values or rules that are the roots of this company. As a trainee coming into this diving company; functionality and execution of the equipment, emergency situations, mechanics of the equipment and how to use the equipment properly are all components that I would want to include in my training program.

26,"It is important to recognize their past leadership programs and commitments to their life skills. If this dive shop is looking for important leadership skills then they should be looking for past successes in the dive shop. The dive shop is most likely looking for people that know other workers, can work under pressure, a friendly face, and organized. I think to train someone in something like this they should have a set program such as ""diving into leadership!"" This could be a fun name where they do a 3 hour (normal after work meeting) time limit full of different leadership workshops such as working under pressure, intense issues, how to be their for your colleagues, how to separate work life and home life. The importance of leadership is being able to separate work and home in a timely manner way. Meaning that when you get off work you limit yourself to emails and text messages but as a manager you know how to still be there for employers. Leadership skills are not just handed to a person the person has to work to have the capability to be selfless rather than selfish through work. Diving into leadership sounds like it could be serious and fun having workshop activities rather than basic boring power points could help keep attention and I think having this workshop would be beneficial to not just upcoming manager but any employer that feels the want to step into that role of taking on leadership and that is how the Dive shop will be able to find a good manager for the employees that WANT to attend diving into leadership because they clearly have a want rather than a basic yup I guess I will try that out. Some might be more skilled in workshops and others might be completely lost but having individual workshops surrounded by peers is good for a person, but having team workshops will help find the perfect manager also. Teamwork is the most basic and powerful thing a workplace can have. To have teamwork means to be able to work alone and together and that is where power comes into play. If a manager does not build a foundation of trust and honesty it will bring a negative work atmosphere to make a work place fun, trustworthy, and a good vibes means the manager AND boss have stepped into the right shoes for leadership and created a positive atmosphere. A positive atmosphere then means more sales for the dive shop bring even more positive hormones leaving people to go home in a positive mood. So all around a managers leadership completely ruins a works atmosphere if they don't want to be there and if they have no positivity when it comes into creativity, work ethic, and respect for coworkers which makes diving into leadership the perfect 3 hour workshop for whoever feels the WANT to be a manger!

27,"My leadership training would consist of very personal connections with the trainee. No powerpoint presentation, exact lists of rules or steps to follow, none of that. If they had the skills to be promoted to manager, then it’s going to basically be a sink or swim situation. 
Before getting hired, I would give the trainees a very long 1 on 1 talk about representation of the company, how they are now extensions of upper management in stores and have the power to run the branch as they see fit, and if they have any questions about how to handle a situation that I will be available. I will give them a detailed description of their duties in the manager position a long with quotas they must meet and some of the rules they must follow. 

For the next 6 months or so I will keep a close eye on how the new manager is running his facility as a sort of probationary period. I will check in on employees periodically to see how they feel about the new management and look at the profit change in that branch. If the branch is being run smoothly by the end of that 6 months, I will end the probationary period and greatly limit my visits to the branch. If the branch isn’t being run how upper management wants it to be run, I will have a long talk with the manager and extend the probationary period for an undetermined number of months. If the manager still hasn’t proven capable, his promotion or possibly his employment may be put into question.

To assist the manager in his probationary period I will be on standby call for his office. During my check ups on the branch I will observe any issues and share them with the manager in order to see if he handles the issue in an orderly fashion.

Overall, I don’t believe in the typical sort of training program. If an employee is ready for a promotion, there shouldn’t be a need to try and train them like hunting hounds. Everyone has their own style of handling things, and as long as the interests of the overall company are forefront then how managers choose to run their branches is of no interest to me.",,,11,6,11,13,13,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Yes,Slightly Experienced
28,"To begin, the current managers would have a way to submit potential new managers (current employees), and once someone was submitted, they will be approved by the other managers/owners. If approved, the employee will be notified of this potential and will have the opportunity to accept and begin training. Training will begin by shadowing a manager, to see a typical day. Next, the employee will go through several steps and sessions to master leadership skills necessary. First, they will reflect on the standards they are currently required to meet. This functions both as a check-in to see if current employees are aware of the standards they are supposed to reach and as a reflection as the employee receives a promotion. Next, the employee will learn briefly about the most important standards of employees and how the bar approaches them. For example, cleanliness might be a standard. For this session, the potential manager will be re-trained in the cleanliness practices and be taught what to look out for when standards are not met. By re-learning what current employees are required to do, it helps the manager understand their perspective and keeps a close relationship. After the new manager has been refreshed on standards, they will go through a course on sensitivity to various issues and identities. This might include workplace harassment and gender/racial discrimination. It will be indicated to them that honesty and integrity are values the employees are encouraged to prioritize in the event that one of these sensitivities is not met. The manager will be briefed on technological requirements, like how to send out mass memos, how to check time cards, and the financial processes behind the POS system. They will next be trained on emergency protocols, how to deescalate customer complaints, and the best forms of discipline for employees who are not meeting standards.

When I would hire the managers in the first place and even before their training, I would see how much information they knew about the topic before hand. After that, I would be able to see how much information and training that is necessary. To improve their leadership skills, I would begin with basic techniques of interacting with people in general. Human communication is key in a job like this because managers need to be able to communicate positively with customers as well as resolving conflicts. This could include classes of certain language that is used as well as how to help others when help is needed. To be able to aquire the skills of a leader, I would set up the training program to include activities like team building as well as exercises where they are forced to make decisions based on the good of the group. To be able to become a good leader, considering the thoughts of others as well as knowing when your knowledge is more superior are both very important skills. After they have general leadership skills mastered or at least to the point where they are able to practice what they have learned, I would put them in positions where they would be leaders for the dive shop with previously trained leaders nearby if help is needed. Hands on experience is the best way to be able to train others to be able to practice their skill. During this training period of hands on learning, I would give them people that would just be nice and comfortable,  but also expose them to what it means to represent the people in the store which is the job of managers when negative comments are present.

I think they should have a dedicated class that combines classroom and hands on training for their activity. At the beginning of the camp the group is split into even teams, and in the beginning have a sit down class to talk about the important traits that can be seen in a leader. I think these traits should be loyalty, bravery and responsibility. Teach your trainees these traits, and stress different examples in which these traits can be implied. Then, we run through simulated scenarios where everyone has a turn at being in the leadership position. This is an important factor in all of it, participants should not have the choice whether they wanna be leaders in the scenario or not, during these scenarios you should be able to point at any random participant and tell them to take the reins of their selected team. 
Have each team run through simulated scenarios, some scenarios may be minor like talking to a costumer, others much more bigger, like a severe incident in the shop. Have each team rotate through scenarios, switching leaders always before every run, and finally, if the WHOLE team passes the scenario, then they pass the class.

34,"I would start by assessing how much knowledge the employee has about dive gear and the shop in general. This would help me get a baseline idea of where to start. This assessment would take the form of a standardized survey or questionnaire that would have basic information that an employee should know. Based on the results of the survey, I would evaluate how much training needs to be done. The training would incorporate broad topics such as, fear and materials around the shop and then it would lead in to basic diving instructions. This should mostly be review because I am assuming the people applying to be managers have already worked at the shop. Once this is completed, I would conduct a group interview and ask the group a question that would require them to work as a team. It would be some scenario where they’re stuck on a desert island or something and I would evaluate how each person performed in a group setting. Did they control the conversation? Did they leave space for others to speak? Were they inclusive? Did they take up too much space and not listen to others? After that, I would have them express their ideas about what qualities a true leader should hold. Then, I would finish by having two actors come in and be in a fake conflict and see how the managers handle that. Do they know how to de-escalate the situation or do they continue to build on the problem and enrage the people more? Do they listen to both sides of the argument and attempt to be unbiased? All of these exercises are meant to show the evaluator if the candidates are able to be confident and assertive while still respecting others and making sure everyone’s voices get heard.

39,"Create a program with online modules to teach and assess learning. These can be done so the user must watch videos and read information and follow that with a quiz to scale learning comprehension. Within leadership, I think it would be best to teach communication, self-awareness, delegation, motivation, problem-solving, adaptability,  and feedback/coaching. These various skills to learn could be different modules that one must pass before reaching the next. They could include an initial quiz to have the person state what they know about that topic or how they would define it. Following the quiz they could have various lessons, videos, and trial experiments, to best learn that skill for application. Following different steps within the module, at the end would be an assessment, similar to that at the beginning, but more specific with aspects they should have learned and ways this would impact the job position. We can have in person training and experiences tied into this so they have hands on practice with some of these skills. We can also make a program that is many problems one may face in the management position, within this program would be conflictual situations that they must do steps to complete and see the outcome of their choices. Like a choose your own adventure book, each step they make in this program could lead them to a better or worse outcome. Having an experience of seeing and learning of possible issues for this will make it easier when it comes to handling it hands on. This way they are able to see things that may help or hurt this process when doing so in a real life situation. Along with these various steps can be situations of self-assessment, this would help show what they feel they have improved on compared to what they feel they still need work.

Consider studying the experiences of successful leaders to gain inspiration and learn from their strategies.  4. **Practice and Application:**    - Put your learning into action by taking on leadership opportunities whenever possible. This could involve leading projects, volunteering for leadership roles in organizations, or mentoring others.    - Practice active listening, effective communication, conflict resolution, and decision-making in various situations. Seek feedback from peers and mentors to continuously improve.  5. **Build Relationships and Networks:**    - Cultivate relationships with peers, mentors, and other leaders who can provide support, guidance, and feedback. Networking with a diverse group of individuals can offer different perspectives and insights.    - Develop your emotional intelligence to better understand and connect with others. Empathy, compassion, and interpersonal skills are essential for effective leadership.  6. **Adaptability and Continuous Learning:**    - Leadership is not static, so be willing to adapt and evolve based on changing circumstances and feedback. Stay curious and open to new ideas and perspectives.    - Seek out challenging opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone. Embrace failure as a learning opportunity and use setbacks as fuel for growth.  7. **Lead by Example:**    - Demonstrate the values and behaviors you expect from others. Your actions speak louder than words, so strive to embody integrity, accountability, and professionalism in all your interactions.    - Foster a positive and inclusive work environment where team members feel valued, empowered, and motivated to contribute their best.  8. **Seek Feedback and Reflect:**    - Regularly solicit feedback from colleagues, team members, and supervisors on your leadership effectiveness. Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments.    - Take time to reflect on your experiences as a leader. What worked well? What could have been done differently? Continuous reflection is essential for personal growth and development.  By following these steps and committing to ongoing learning and development, you can enhance your leadership skills and become a more effective and impactful leader.",10,9,12,12,9,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,No,Completely Inexperienced

I feel it is also important that the managers have a good relationship with one another so facilitating a good sense of community within the managers I would view as important. I think learning each person's individual leadership style would also be quite important to know within the first week. Within week 2, I would work on skills that I would view as valuable to both the company and new managers such as time management, an overview of how the store runs and operates behind the scenes that the new managers might not have realized prior to their promotion from just a general employee. Within the final week, week 3, I would make sure they get lots of training within customer service, identifying needs of customers and things they might need to have available to make grocery shopping more accessible to everyone (ex if someone is disabled in a way) and how to best handle situations that wouldn't occur everyday. As a local grocery store, it is important that you can keep high standards, and if this is a grocery store in a small town that you can build relationships with regular customers.

63,"In order to train previous employees in order to be fit to work as managers of a grocery store there is a large amount of training needed. They need to be trained to be able to handle the high amount of responsibility, them being in charge of other employees, and to not get overwhelmed with any of this. I think the best way to do this is through shadowing, the new managers will benefit from shadowing the managers who were working before them to understand their daily responsibilities, mannerisms, and how they act to their employees. another important aspect for me is for them to not get overwhelmed so offering resources for questions and prepping them with all the knowledge they need to have pamphlets and binders with important store information, rosters of employees, phone numbers etc. Informational videos would also be beneficial. Hands-on training and shadowing are the number one source for information and experience gain. So 2-3 days of this type of work should prepare them well.

64,"I would suggest to incorporate training that involves the rest of the workers at the grocery store, to emphasize the differences between the worker's old level in the company and their new responsibilities. They should practice their leadership with people they are familiar with to get honest and responsive feedback. If there were other managers currently working, I would create a mentor program where the newly promoted worker could shadow the current manager for a day. It would be helpful to do a couple of these shadowing days from different managers to compare and contrast how they both fulfill their jobs similarly and differently. To be comprehensive, the training program would last one week, filled with a couple of these shadowing days and some team building exercises with the rest of the workers. Most importantly, they should receive feedback from current managers, workers, and customers at the grocery store. Since the community of customers is diverse, they should be trained on cultural and religious diversity, so if that ever came up while they were working, they could respond properly.

65,"    Training would begin with qualifications, including CPR certification, Emergency Response Training, and and scuba-related trainings from scuba agencies that allow a dive shop to have a scuba diving certification, meaning the shop has qualified managers. Doing all this training would ensure the individual is up for the task of being a manager. As a leader, they will need to be in charge and therefore know how to protect their customers and employees.
      The next leadership quality would be conflict resolution. Dealing with conflicts are part of a manager's job, so conflict resolution is important training to keep the peace in the workplace. I would do this through an external agency trained in Human Resources, they can usually provide insight on conflict and resolution.
      Another leadership quality would be accountability. Nobody wants a manager who doesn't think anything is their fault, so training accountability and empathy could help employees. I would do this by acting out scenarios or giving them scenarios in which leadership failed and show them how they could take accountability for what happened in those scenarios.
       The last quality I would train for is lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is continuing education in a field because it is always changing. I would do this by providing places where new scuba information may be found.
      I believe that this training program would create well rounded managers for the scuba shop to trust.

66,"It is important to implement boundaries within the work system as a good foundation and trust. To achieve this we can start by making sure the other managers are familiar with each other and know that their goal is to work as one and that they are all on the same playing field which will establish the needed boundaries for this operation to work. To further the process it could be beneficial to not just sit them in front of a screen and talk to them about what would best work, such as a lecture-based idea. Instead, we could implement a few slides about how it is important to deal with incoming employees and then to next have them interact with one another or have other people such as myself try and put them in a real-world situation that can test their abilities and give them strengthens when it comes to dealing with not only their employees but also each other on a typical work day. It could also be useful to have them observe a similar company whether that is through videos online or even going to another store and observing. Then they can take down things that they think worked, didn't work, and how they would go about changing the things that didn't work. It is also important to have good problem solving skills, so we could bound the managers by putting them into different situations such as problem solving games to see how they work together when a problem arises. Then we can look into everyone's strengths and see how we can flourish as a community. It is also important to get started, once these steps are done we can start the business, but in the beginning have a weekly or biweekly meeting to evaluate the work conditions and how things are being run.

67,"This training program will involve putting the trainees in circumstances that do not happen often but it is necessary to know how to work through them. Simulations that involve working with difficult customers, difficult employees, or problems that come up with product will be held for the trainees to practice their problem-solving abilities. Another training method would be one tbat involves figuring out what to do in a crisis, who to contact, and how to handle the situation. Also promoting the stores current deals or new drops will be something that the trainees will train for. Being trained how to communicate is the most important part.

68,"It’s most important that any manager is trained to be patient with the employees that they’re managing, so I think that will need to be a central part of the program. The manager should be trained in the way they teach as well. It’s best when a manager isn’t seen as a boss, but a colleague who has more experience than the average worker, and so knows how to help the others improve. This manager also needs to be very comfortable in aggressive situations, because almost all disgruntled customers end up speaking with the manager sooner or later. I think the training for these managers should happen during the trainees’ shifts. They would still be paid, but one hour per 6-hour shift should be spent going through a training program that revolves around being kind to both your employees and customers, as I said before. After they get done with the program, they should spent a week shadowing the current manager to see how they deal with the demands of the job.

I would also ask them how they wished their previous managers acted or led the store and have them best try to implement these strategies in the grocery store. I would also ask that the manager in training participate in a leadership conference/course so they can learn how to lead in a way that is not domineering.

They would then answer if they are definitely likely, probably likely, unsure, probably unlikely, and definitely unlikely to do something. Then I would take an interview with the workers to see why they answered the way they did. For the actual training program itself, it would probably be something the workers do not know about. I would take one of the hypothetical scenarios from the survey and have it happen in real life. Then I would see how long it would take for the employees to act to see if they were really telling the truth. Another part of the training program would definitely be to leave someone in charge, but have a fellow worker be an observer on how they take that responsibility.

After we would then go into leadership strategies and how the new managers can attempt to take very friendly relationships with their coworkers and learn to be a good boss who still has those friendship qualities.

It would be required for them to partake in duties design to those areas to fully understand what area goes through on a daily basis. In other words, treat them as if they are training for that position and move them after to the next section which the trainee has not been part of. This way the trainee would have decent knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses each area of the store. It will allow to also get to know the employees of each section developing a stronger bond among them and listen to their critics since they are the ones that have spent most the time around those grounds. The training program would require on average a week of each section of the store, or if the trainee feels like they now have a good sense of knowledge of the appointed area (it would require proof or demonstration). Afterwards, the trainee would start management training. This way the trainee would have built up a bond b/w coworkers and customers.

76,"Welcome to the ____ Store Manager Training Program! We're very impressed by your dedication and drive towards excellence, consistently exceeding our customers expectations. In this training course you will put to use the skills and knowledge of our store, and elevate them to your highest potential.

Module 1: Managerial supervision
In this module, you will learn how to oversee your employees to ensure productivity.
When overseeing employees make sure to not fall into the same repetitive route around the store. Employees may begin to know when you'll be around and might only work while your presence is expected. Instead, choose a different path each time you walk the floor. 

Module 2: Customer etiquette
In this module, you will take your customers skills and combine them with you new abilities and understanding of our store!
When speaking with a customer, remember, they may not always be right but if it appeases them to think that they are, then they are! Our customers are loyal to us so let's be loyal to them too. As a manager, you an exercise your ability to discount certain items (corporate approved) when you see fit to strengthen the bond with our customers.

Module 3: conflict deescalation
In this module you will learn how to prevent workplace conflict
As a manager, you are now able to ""call the shots"". By this we mean that you can now fire whomever is the origin or cause of workplace conflict. Of course, remember that a manager who fires too many employees is an origin of conflict from higher up so don't get trigger happy. Always seek to compromise!

Thank you for your continued effort and value you provide to the ____ Store family! We know you'll do great things here!

83,"To start the training, employees aiming for a management position must know the company objectives, meaning their values, mission, and culture. Prospective managers must also have or work to obtain enhanced communication skills and strong interpersonal skills. These two traits will allow for more genuine communication amongst customers and team members while also allowing for teamwork, bonding, and conflict diversion or resolution. On top of this, these individuals should show that they have or can work towards having an advanced understanding of problem solving skills and decision making skills in their daily lives while also showing that they are responsible, timely, and efficient in their work. All of these traits add up to the satisfaction of our customers brand wise and location wise, but will also allow for us to ensure that our employees are also satisfied, no matter where they may be working in the store. 
Using these previously mentioned traits, we can build a management training program to allow for everyone involved to reach their peak level of performance before placement in this position, as everyone involved is likely to be starting at different levels. Presenting these traits in a course-like structure, whether that be in person at a workshop or online, could prove to be very helpful. Not only would these pieces of information be being presented in a classroom-like setting, but we could also allow for independent work and interactivity to allow for a sense of both independence and teamwork while going through the materials. The use of feedback and evaluation from higher ups involved with the program or company will also prove to be helpful, as we will be able to better monitor the progression of each individual involved and provide them with the best support possible. 
Towards the end of each section or towards the end of the program, participants could partake in an exam to test their overall knowledge and understanding of the material and the position of manager for the grocery store chain. From there, we will see if there are any individuals who may not be fit for the position or may need additional help with understanding the materials and vice versa.

89,"My training program would be a two part seminar. The first seminar would be centered around individual strengths and leadership styles. Each person presents unique talents that they rely on when leading others. These differences in leadership can be presented after each manager completes a leadership style test and has their top 5 talents (i.e. Clifton strengths). A presentation will be given over how all strengths are useful and how different leadership styles can be utilized when working with a group. The importance of working through our individuals and using them to make the team stronger will be emphasized. There will be group- based discussion on what each individual brings to the team and how each member can complement the others. The first seminar as a whole is centered around individual strengths and how we can use them as a team. The second seminar will be centered around using these strengths and leadership when managing or leading others. Presentations over sympathy, active listening, and using person-first language will be given. There will be a group practice/discussion about how to handle difficult situations e.g., employees skipping work. This will be a more practical and applying what the first seminar was about.  It is important for managers to recognize that each of their employees have unique needs and respond to leadership in different ways. Adaptability and supporting their employees are important skills for managers so that their employees in turn can provide the best possible services to the customers.

91,"I think that there are many skills that make up a leader and some people have them naturally while others must practice to gain them. In order to ensure that all the managers of the grocery store are well equipped to run the business I think that it would be good to have them attend a two hour education session every week for three weeks. This would only take two hours out of their weeks and would add up to six hours of training. In these two hours a current manager as well as the business owner and those in charge, would deliver presentations on different concepts that are important. One week could be about the literal human interaction aspect whether that be with other employees or customers. They could discuss the importance of listening and understanding, treating everybody with respect, and understanding what is within their power and what is not. The second week could focus more on the logistics of how they want the store to be run. This would have to cover everything from how the shelves are organized and how sales are run or what the economics side of the business looks like. The final week should focus on the vision for the story as a business. They should cover what they intended outcomes are so that each new manager understands what their purpose in working is every day. In addition to these presentations, after each meeting they will be assigned an online course that basically allows them to think about what they learned a little more and provide answers and thoughts to questions asked about the topics. This way, it is clear that they are truly taking in the information and have a grasp on the concepts. During these three weeks, the future managers should also complete shadowing hours. They would follow the current managers around as they do their jobs so that they can see what it is really like to b win that position and get an opportunity to ask all the questions they have before they are expected to be on their own.

92,"To design an effective leadership training program for upcoming managers at a local grocery store chain, it's important to hold the program somewhere that isn't at the workplace i.e. NOT in the grocery store. A good, neutral location for a training program like this could be at a conference center, retreat ground or recreational area community center. By getting the employees off-campus, it provides an unfamiliar environment where one is acquiring and fine tuning their leadership skills so that they feel confident enough to learn and use these skills in places outside of their workplace. Next, one must determine how long the program will last. A good sweet spot is between 2 and half and five days. Since the objective of the program is to train up a new level of corporate leadership, it would be most effective to hold the training program over a standard five-day work week. Now that the when and where are determined, let's lay out the what. The program should consist of full-group training, break out small group training to practice the skills learned in full-group training as well as include testimonies from other leaders, whether these leaders where previous managers at said grocery store chain or other, notable local and possibly even statewide leaders depending on the budget I'm given to work with. Any training program isn't a program without breaks to process and reflect on what's been learned and how that ties to the objective of the objective of the leadership training program. Each day, excluding the obligatory breaks for breakfast and lunch, participants should be given no more than two hours of reflecting time to process how what they've learned will make them into a better leader. The content of the training program can touch on skills that include but are not limited to: effective v. passive communication: how to be transparent with your team, avoiding burnout: encouraging employees who struggle to give their complete effort to their job, different ways to stay organized (e.g. budgeting, finance, stocking the shelves), and effective networking tips for securing sponsorships with nearby businesses and other grocery chains.",,,14,7,14,6,10,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Disagree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Yes,Slightly Experienced
93,"The first step in training the employees to become managers is to educate them in all matters of the store that are typically not available to a regular employee. this would be like the scheduling system, the paycheck system, how to properly cash out the registers and stuff like that. Then, have them shadow a current manager to learn about their leadership style. The trainee was promoted to manager for a reason, so they must have some leadership qualities already. It's important, though, to learn from someone who is currently in the manager position to figure out what works at the store. Next, the trainee should practice different tasks they have not previously encountered. This could be like reprimanding an employee for consistently being late or having to talk down an angry customer. These personal communication skills are vital to a good leader. There should also be a section in the training with other managers about how to deal with adverse situations, like a robbery or physical disputes between customers. Staying levelheaded and coming up with quick solutions is helpful. The next step in the program would be to practice handling the money. There are a lot of things that could go wrong, on small and large scales, when dealing with money, especially at a grocery store, so practice is necessary. The first few trials should be with supervision and then the trainee can attempt it on their own. Have the trainee co-manage the store with an experienced manager, fulfilling all of the tasks required of them for the day. Then, have the trainee manage the store virtually independently, with some supervision but not anyone hovering over their shoulder. Finally, the trainee can attempt to manage the store on their own and report back to the head manager any issues that arose. If there were problems, the head manager/trainee should re-train the new manager in those areas.

94,"First off, I would ensure that my managers are also diverse since they are serving a diverse, loyal customer community. I would have them watch modules and training mantles as a baseline before going into deeper and more in depth training. I would emphasize the modules and training that talk about respect towards customers and biases. Biases are a natural part of being human and we all have biases,  but I would make sure that when working, my managers' biases will not get in the way of the customer and my managers will not judge a customer due to their race, religion, sex, age,
gender, background etc. After baseline modules, I'd have them partake in hypothetical situations where they will be faced with a problem and evaluate how to proceed. I'm debating on making them unknown, for example, the manger won't know it is a 'test' and the customer will be a paid actor, like how there are confederates in researches. It will be like those social experiments people do that we see online all of the time. For example, maybe I'll have one 'customer' say offensive things to another 'customer' and see how the manager handles the situation. Leading and leadership is also hard, so I will also make sure my managers know the difference between dictating and delegating and will understand how to properly delegate tasks while not becoming a dictator.

95,"For this training all upcoming managers will meet together with an instructor. They will be tested on what to do on certain situations. These situations include:
- a person shop lifting 
- an elderly person needing assistance
- a difficult costumer asking for the manger
- a costumer that does not speak the same language as the employees and is asking for help
- a medical emergency 
- a natural disaster (earthquake, fire, tornado, etc.) 
- an active shooter drill

Before being tested they will be briefed on what to do in these situations by the instructor. After being briefed the upcoming managers will then all be individually tested. One person is picked to be tested and all of the other people will act out the situations. This will help them understand both sides of the situation incase they experience dealing with a difficult customer once promoted. They will be able to see the responsibilities of a manager as well as build connections with others and develop teamwork and leadership skills. They will be able to practice before their actual test but once in the test they will need to deal with all situations with some happening at the same time. This is essential as there is no way of predicting what can happen. Once the upcoming managers have been tested and passed they will be able to be promoted to manager.",,,6,8,12,4,12,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Yes,Somewhat Inexperienced
96,"This leadership program would consist of teaching incoming managers how to facilitate team building as well as teaching them big picture practical skills needed for the grocery store such as dealing with customers, managing finances etc. Some aspects of the training program would be online, where the employees in training would have to deal with simulated conversations with disgruntled customers and employees. Others would be in person, where an existing manager would walk them through aspects of their day as manager such as dealing with the finances.

97,A proposed training program I would suggest to train the managers would include how to manage conflicts with employees and ways to communicate between different grocery chains and people. By teaching conflict engagement skills and communication skills I think this would be a sufficient way to train managers.,,,10,8,14,11,13,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,No,Completely Inexperienced
98,"To begin, since these upcoming managers are most likely have a pretty strong sense of familiarity of their store and how it is run, so after giving them a brief introduction on the system they will need to understand as a higher-up employee, I would give them a specific leadership training task. For example, a two person blind maze. There will be two pieces of paper, both with a grid on them. The upcoming manager's paper will have a maze on it and they will have to lead a lower-scale employee (important that it is not a higher up) through the grid so that they can pass through the maze in a certain amount of time. This would be a great exercise to see how a manager handles time-sensitive tasks, but also how they respond in a place of more power in giving out jobs to do and leading people in jobs without getting frustrated at the employees. It forces the manager to have clear communication with the employee and lead them, while still having a fairly hands-off approach so that the employee can learn as well.

99,"The proposed training program consists of the upcoming managers having 2 days shadowing and following around a manager to see what the job entials. Next, there will be leadership workshops where they do activities to practice leadership skills. The activities can consist of team building or leading a team through a specific challenge. There will also be presentations on leadership qualities needed for the job. Lastly, there will have a day where they get to practice the role of a manager while being observed, before going on their own. The program will be spread out over a week.

100,"First i would start more of a lecture style, describing the different qualities of leadership and the importance of leadership as a manager in this grocery store. I would like to bring in some speakers to talk about experience and real life scenarios that they have experienced. I think it’s important to hear from other people how impactful excellent leaders are and what specific qualities made their boss particularly impactful. Then I would make it more discussion based, giving different scenarios that would require strong leadership and having them share how they would handle it and reform their ideas based on others sharing. Lastly, I would give them each a smaller task to prove their abilities. For example, “the aisle cleaning and restocking is not up to par, what is a solution” and see how they handle it and what they do to fix the issue by delegating tasks, creating a “closing chore chart” for employees, a reward system for employees, etc. After this if there are no more questions then they can shadow the current manager for a week or two and then start!",,,9,10,7,7,9,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Yes,Slightly Experienced
101,"The first thing the managers need to be trained on is customer service and relations. This is being friendly with the loyal customers who come into the store and look to purchase your goods. This can be successfully performed by a top-down look at all of the employees at the store starting with the managers. They must have an excited look to ensure the customers feel welcomed and appreciated properly. 

The managers must also need to learn the ins and outs of all of the moving pieces that come with running a grocery store such as incoming products, shelf management/location of goods, what the store has in stock, and what needs to be purchased. 

The managers must also get trained on diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This can be seen through embracing diversity within the team and community while recognizing unconscious biases that instead need to promote inclusivity. This will create a welcoming environment for all of the customers and the employees. 

The last thing that the new managers must learn is how to attack problem-solving and decision-making within the store. This can be seen by analyzing common challenges in the grocery store environment that take critical thinking for effective decision-making. There also needs to be solutions that improve the operational efficiency and customer satisfaction at the store.

102,"'- Short course about what is expected of leaders and some tips to be a good one
- Shadowing the current manager to see what they do
- Give trainees some practice making decisions and talking to others as a leader like directing a smaller task in the grocery store. (Ex. managing the workers unloading new deliveries and telling them where to put the stuff)
- Have trainees be the manager for the day while the real manager watches and advises them
- Have trainees be the manager for the day while the real manager watches but does NOT advise them (only intervenes in dire circumstances)",,,5,7,14,9,9,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,"No, but I've used other generative AI (Bing AI, Google Bard, etc)",Slightly Experienced
